- CSS Fallback <br>
  The fallback descriptor can be used to specify a counter style to fall back to if the current counter style cannot create a marker representation for a particular counter value.

- Browser Polyfills <br>
  A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

- Modernizr <br>
  Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects the features available in a user's browser. This lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser isn't supported or loading a polyfill.
